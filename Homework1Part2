You can consult any available resources (printed or online) when doing
homework assignments. Always read and understand the material you find.
Then put it aside and start writing your own answer. This ensures that the
work you submit is different enough that it becomes your own. Similarly,
you can discuss your ideas with your class mates for homework
assignments. However, do not do your homework with individuals outside of
your group. You are welcome to use concepts that were not covered in class,
which you might already know or found online, but you must be able to
verbally explain your solution and show thorough understanding of the
concepts you used, when asked.

2. Include sources as a separate document to be submitted with each

participation grade.
